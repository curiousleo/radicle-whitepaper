Replicated state machines are an essential paradigm for programming
fault-tolerant systems. The prototypical RSM pattern involves deploying a
deterministic state machine across multiple server nodes; these nodes respond
to client requests and, by agreeing on an ordered for these requests, ensure consensus
on their state and output. If some fraction of nodes is unavailable (or in the looser
requirements of byzantine fault tolerence, if they are responding arbitrarily),
the overall system can still function correctly.

Replicated services may include key-value stores, file-systems,
append-only logs, account balances, etc., each of which
is typically re-implemented for any new instance, leading to substantial development
costs, as well as the introduction of subtle bugs in interim states, during
inevitable software upgrades. In this paper, we describe a language, \rad{}, for
defining the behaviour of replicated state machines (RSMs) independently of the
underlying consensus. The language is designed so that new domain-specific
languages (DSLs) can easily be defined for each service provided by the system.
Each such DSL is the definition of an RSM. The expressions of the DSL
are the RSMs inputs, the value such an expression evaluates to its outputs, and
the changes in the environment its state changes.

Thus, if an RSM represents a ledger of accounts, expressions or inputs may be transfers, the
state may be the balance and ownership of accounts, and outputs may be the new
balances of affected accounts, or an error message if the transfers are not
allowed (due to insufficient funds or incorrect permissions).

Additionally, using the same mechanism as for DSL-definition (namely, an
\emph{eval redefinition}), we provide a way for upgrading the DSL itself
\emph{with the same guarantees of agreement} between nodes as the underlying
consensus, reducing the coordination difficulty of an upgrade. DSLs can be
defined in such a way that their \emph{re}-definitions are themselves just one of the
sorts of inputs the RSM accepts; thus nodes will agree on the ordering of an
upgrade with respect to other inputs, and will not go out of sync as a
consequence of update.

While (crucially for the purpose of ensuring consensus) the core of the language
is deterministic, \rad{} also possesses an additional set of primitive operations
that allow side-effects. We show how a publish-subscribe model for side-effects
(or in the formalism of \cite{Cartwright1994}, an effect-handling central which
is never provided continuations) allows for responding to outputs of the state
machine or state changes in a non-deterministic way, without endangering the
determism of the state machine itself. This in turn makes the separation between
reads and writes correct by construction.

\rad{} has been developed in the context of a broader effort to create a
community-owned platform for open-source development (\oscoin{}), which
includes a consensus algorithm and networking component. The \oscoin{}
platform allows users and communities to create permissioned and permissionless
RSMs with their own semantics, be it to maintain decentralized,
version-controled code, issues, pull requests, or collective decision-making.
\rad{} is
oriented towards making that process as simple and clear as possible. We leave further
discussion of the broader \oscoin{} system for a subsequent manuscript.

In the rest of the paper, we describe the language in more detail (Section
\ref{s:language}) and show some example applications built with \rad{}---first,
an upgradable key-value store and then a currency
(Section \ref{s:examples}).
